installed django debug toolbar
what would need to be cached?

for example when user clicks on profile the view_profile in accounts is run and then the accounts/profuile.html is rendered. the view has a get and the template is listing
properties of the user object.

Consider adding indexes to fields that you frequently query using filter(), exclude(), order_by(), etc. as indexes may help to speed up lookups. Note that determining the best indexes is a complex database-dependent topic that will depend 
on your particular application. 
The overhead of maintaining an index may outweigh any gains in query speed.

need to change to postregresql

does pagination reduce server load? 

incredibly badly structured relational database (many of our queries JOIN 7 or 8 different tables to get a result).

just installed disqus. Dont remove comment model until fully tested.

Need to adjust media rule for navbar

writing django blogpost on creating archive made me think about how querysets actually work. So am querying the database to retrieve the time of a blogpost. or even more simpler 
doing x = blogpost.objects.all(). I think creating a queryset doesnt hit the database at all. Why did django make this sound amazing on the documentation? use django debug toolabr to see how much 
times ur hittng the database.

15.6.18

Django doesnt hit the database until you call save

>>> from blog.models import Blog
>>> b = Blog(name='Beatles Blog', tagline='All the latest Beatles news.')
>>> b.save()

2 ways to represent month year on all pages:

tried doing for loop which works but cant represent all of the months and years yet
tried using django templating language date filter but uses view variable allposts which i would have to define in everypage but cant 
present them in accounts as it isnt home model. 


Using for loop in view means i have to define all blogposts in every view and anyway i dont know how to present the list correctly yet. I can 
make an undistinct list in shell though

Using a for loop in template base.html is difficult because it doesnt work on all different pages.

completed  - created a template context processor. so one view takes a context and can be used in all templates need to write about it.

starting poitn for archvie display is so post and alsoew thjus 

                    <!-- {% for x in allposts %}
                {{x.date.year}}
                {% endfor %} -->
                <!-- <li><a href="{% url 'home:blogpost_year_archive' year=2018 %}"></a>{{ year|date:"Y" }}</a></li> -->

4.6.18

Padding left to get col md 2 to RHS means mobile layout becomes fked up. dont know how 2 solve this yet.

convert datetime queryset to just the year. to include t which is defined in def(home) in all other pages means i have to define t in every view wghich
is wrong. So i need to use template context processor or somat. Cant do it current way as i have one variable t representing many dates so i cant link each of them
use solution last bookmarked which does the template context processor ting and does the template.

cant really add padding media rule as it would be different for every size device.

"|title" is a django template function used to capitalize first letter just as the title() function is in python. Without lookin for solution on google i 
went to shell did x= blogpost.objects.all() x[0] = <User:heliuM> so tried to isolate the heliuM by doing x.author.username then did x.author.username.title() and it
worked so i thought which model should i modify the user model or blogpost model. user model is built in so i thought id mess with the blogpost model
and tried to return the str

just realised i need to put all the stuff on roight side of page(whcih will appear block by block on mnobile underneath one another) on base.html but i aint got 
col-md-10 on base.html so i really need to think through what i need to change. Because otherwuse i will be repeating my code on all pages.

I feel more productive without music

solved pagination problem : Used django pagination from docs + simplebetterthancomplex to paginate. Found that it was partially complete splution from comment.
Followed link in comments to medium.com//sdasasfsdsfdsf found a solution(https://medium.com/@sumitlni/paginate-properly-please-93e7ca776432)  which involved something new

    1.how to make  custom template tags. Had to make 2 template tags : i.proper_paginate.py and ii.link_name.py. more details in link above.
    2. The paginator_template.html in the link above was written for cbv but i had a fbv. So i could have changed the fbv to cbv and adapted ( or at least tried). But i 
    tried to mess with template and adapted by finding out the variables i had in my view to match the variables in my template by comparing it to the solution above. 

    In that solution they use page_ob, is_paginated paginator.num_pages and anorther one i think and pass that to template whcih is what the solution 
    does as that is a class based view. SO i have variable in my view all_posts which corresponds to allposts in template. so i replaced page_obj with allposts 
    but that didnt work. Then realised they had paginator.num_pages as well so i put allposts.paginator.num_pages. But i kept  getting error 
    /Attribute Error 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'num_pages' . The solution was to put 'paginator':paginator' in my args so i was failing to link the fact that paginator was
    used as a variable in my view as well as the class based view in the solution. Remember the soltuion didnt post their view(CBV) . So relaly i just forgot to pass the 
    variable to the template which I did by passing it to args in view

little project : atm on blog.html current slug is presented with dashes, write little program to remove dashes and capitalize first letter of each word. may have problems wit apostrophs etc
didnt need to do this just changed .slug to .title in template - done 

10th may



footer on base.html. doesnt effect login.html as that does not extend base.html i think. style : contact/site map/
you have to keep reflecting on what you've done otherwise you forget it. Life tip. - done


can use {{ request.path }}
{{ request.get_full_path }} to get current path, with li span a we can get path like home>blog>...but we need it so that the first link is the predecessor of the following link



rule: 2 parts : 1. if on home page then just present home icons 2. if user clicks on link then present a list with the first icon as a link to home page, second link as the page the user is cuirrently on
so its a dynamic list whose length depends on which page the user is on currently. O.

DOING TWO THINGS NOW

FINDING WAY TO SAVE DATABASE CONTENT :

SQLITE3?
USE DJANGO ARCHIVE
Can use pyhthon shell to query databse objects but what if i lose my hardware then i dont have a backup of ym database content as the databse content is not saved in github







To do

for blog posts :

1) virtualenv on windows and envwrapper on mqwin64
2) widget tweaks using finish dudes blog
3) how to install python and django
4) shortuct for conemu

for project :

1) remove include folder and djangoadmin.py from github repo.
2) inline editing - true wysiwyg 


Notes on black background website:

6 months into my project I had a black background with white text. Here is one of the problems i came across during development. 
 django-ckeditor is a WYSIWG editor which replaces the default django admin with a  option better for editing content.
