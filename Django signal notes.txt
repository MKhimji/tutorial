Signals

Event : saved a new User object
When that event happens, you are able to do something based on that.
So, in this case that thing was creating an associated UserProfile object.

Django will save the user object thats been created and then it will run the
post_save signal(which takes the create_profile function below) to create a userprofile object associated with that user

def create_profile  (sender = user argument comes  from post_save connect
if kwargs created just means if user object has been created then create the user profile
instance is current user
